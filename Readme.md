# Dashboard for WPF - How to Set Master Filter in the DashboardControl

The following example demonstrates how to set master filter in the [DashboardControl](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWpf.DashboardControl) control.

The DashboardControl loads a dashboard with two master filter items - the Grid and Range Filter dashboard items. The Chart item displays the filtered data.  

The [DashboardControl.ConfigureDataConnection](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWpf.DashboardControl.ConfigureDataConnection) event is handled to specify the [Extract Data Source](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/115900/creating-dashboards/creating-dashboards-in-the-winforms-designer/providing-data/extract-data-source) filename.

A custom template inserts a command button in the dashboard title with a click action that sets the dashboard's master filter.

The [DashboardControl.SetMasterFilter](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWpf.DashboardControl.SetMasterFilter.overloads) method selects the rows in the [Grid]( https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/15150)  dashboard item. The [DashboardControl.SetRange](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWpf.DashboardControl.SetRange.overloads) method selects the range in the [Range Filter](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/15265) dashboard item.

This example also demonstrates how to handle the [DashboardControl.MasterFilterSet](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWpf.DashboardControl.MasterFilterSet) and [DashboardControl.MasterFilterCleared](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWpf.DashboardControl.MasterFilterCleared) events.
